    <p class="pleft"> Hey Arjun! How's everything going?</p>
    <p class="p2">Hey bro! Everything's good. Just started with some DSA practice today. You?</p>
    <p class="pleft">Nice! I‚Äôm brushing up Java basics. Planning to apply for a full stack internship soon.</p>
    <p class="pleft">That‚Äôs awesome. Don‚Äôt forget to revise object-oriented concepts too.</p>


    <span class="p1">June 4, 2025 (Wednesday)</span>
    <p class="pleft">Rakesh, did you try out that new coding platform I told you about?</p>
    <p class="p2">Yeah! I solved two problems today ‚Äî one on palindrome and one on Harshad numbers.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Great going! I got stuck on the perfect square logic. Need to debug.</p>
    <p class="pleft"> Oh that‚Äôs simple. I‚Äôll send you the approach in a while.</p>


    <span class="p1"> June 5, 2025 (Thursday)</span>
    <p class="pleft"> Arjun, I shared my Day 4 post on LinkedIn. Do check it out!</p>
    <p class="p2"> Saw it! Really well-explained. I liked the perfect square breakdown.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Thanks, buddy! Let‚Äôs continue posting regularly. It keeps us accountable.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Absolutely! Planning a post on constructor chaining next.</p>

    <span class="p1">June 6, 2025 (Friday)</span>
    <p class="pleft">Got any weekend plans?</p>
    <p class="p2">Just coding and a bit of gym. Might go for a movie Saturday evening. You?</p>
    <p class="pleft">Sounds fun. I‚Äôll be preparing for that aptitude test. Need to revise percentages.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Let me know if you need help with formulas. I have a few tricks that might help.</p>
    <p class="pleft"> That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre the best! üòÑ</p>

     <span class="p1">June 7, 2025 (Saturday)</span>
    <p class="pleft"> Good morning, Arjun! Did you start the aptitude revision?</p>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Hey, morning! Yeah, started with time and work problems. It's a bit tricky.</p>
    <p class="p2">Rakesh: Focus on LCM method. It really simplifies things.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Noted. Will try that and solve 10 questions today.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Rakesh: Great. I‚Äôll send you a PDF of common questions I collected.</p>
   <span class="p1">June 8, 2025 (Sunday)</span>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Bro, that PDF helped a lot! Thank you.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Rakesh: Glad it helped. How much did you score in your mock?</p>
    <p class="p2">Arjun: Got 18 out of 25. Not bad, right?</p>
    <p class="pleft">Rakesh: That's great! Just improve your speed now.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Yeah, working on that. Btw, watched the new sci-fi movie last night?</p>
    <p class="pleft">Rakesh: Haha yes! Mind-blowing visuals. Let‚Äôs go watch together next week?</p>
    <span class="p1">June 9, 2025 (Monday)</span>
    <p class="pleft">Rakesh: New week, new goals! What‚Äôs your plan?</p>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Gonna complete Java inheritance today. You?</p>
    <p  class="p2">Rakesh: Focused on interface and abstraction. Let‚Äôs have a code review tonight?</p>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Done! Let‚Äôs do a 30-minute call after dinner.</p>
    <span class="p1">June 10, 2025 (Tuesday)</span>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Yesterday‚Äôs code review really helped me.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Rakesh: Same here. Clean code and explaining logic is a game changer.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Let‚Äôs start contributing on GitHub from next week?</p>
    <p class="p2">Rakesh: Yes! Let‚Äôs choose a simple Java open-source repo to begin with.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Cool. I‚Äôll shortlist some and share links tonight.</p>
    <span class="p1">June 11, 2025 (Wednesday)</span>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Shared 3 GitHub projects. Check and let me know your pick.</p>
    <p class="p2">Rakesh: Checked! I liked the ‚ÄúStudent Record System‚Äù one.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Arjun: Agreed. We can start by fixing UI bugs and improving validation logic.</p>
    <p class="pleft">Rakesh: Perfect. Let‚Äôs fork and start assigning modules today.</p>
